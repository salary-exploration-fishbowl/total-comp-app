# About the Project

This is a lightweight streamlit app for understanding total compensation at Deloitte: distributions of salary, AIP, and % AIP. It is build off data sourced from the Deloitte Bowl on Fishbowl (2021 Total Compensation Survey), data for which can be accessed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HfsaGWobDNaqua6wlQfqB0SOQYrJA5s0xMz7eZDSIrE/edit#gid=1369497600). 

## Using the Website
Users can explore distributions of target metrics using filters in the panel (level, sector, global business, member firm, gender, education, hire source, and years of experience). If a selection does not return valid data, the charts will "break." An update for this outcome is in progress. 

## Considerations 
This project is meant for educational purposes only. It does not report confidential, privileged, or proprietary information. Under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), employees have the right to communicate with other employees at their workplace about their wages.  Wages are a vital term and condition of employment, and discussions of wages are often preliminary to organizing or other actions for mutual aid or protection. Employees may discuss wages in face-to-face conversations and written messages.  When using electronic communications, like social media, keep in mind an employer may have policies against using their equipment. This application was not created using Deloitte-issued equipment. Policies that specifically prohibit the discussion of wages are unlawful.
